A bullet journal/reminder app, all in one, organized in a central feed for you to view and keep track of everything.

While there are many to do and list apps, they never seemed to have everything I wanted in one. 

For example, rather than having to type everything down, I'd like to also have the option to take pictures of emails or notes that have things that need to be done, so I can revisit those tasks in the app rather than having to look for those emails and the notes for reminders.

To summarize, a to do and list app that allows you to take pictures, in addition to writing texts, to keep track of your tasks. Additionally, I would like to have all the tasks in a central feed stylized like Instagram. Where you can view everything in one place. I'd also enable prioritization of tasks by way of sorting by dates, or by tags, so the user can see the highest priority items first.
